# GameEventSystem
## Design Pattern Explanation 
Singleton pattern ensures that only a single instance of the GameEngine class is created throughout the lifetime of the program. This design pattern provides a unified, global access point to the GameEngine, ensuring that all game components, such as players or events, interact with the same engine instance. This helps maintain consistency, as all actions and events are processed by a single controlling entity, avoiding the issues that could arise from multiple instances managing the game state separately.

## Benefits
Simplified Maintenance: The Singleton pattern centralizes the GameEngine's logic and operations into a single instance, making it easier to manage and update. Any changes, whether they are bug fixes or new features, only need to be applied once to this instance. This prevents the risk of inconsistencies that can arise from maintaining multiple instances and ensures that the entire system reflects updates uniformly, simplifying the maintenance process.

System-Wide Consistency: The Singleton pattern ensures that all components in the game interact with the same GameEngine instance, promoting uniformity in event handling. This guarantees that game events are processed in a synchronized manner across all players and components, minimizing the risk of inconsistencies. By using a single instance to manage the game state, the system avoids conflicts that could arise from multiple instances processing events independently, thereby ensuring a stable and predictable behavior throughout the game.

Optimized Memory Usage: The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the GameEngine exists, thereby preventing the creation of multiple instances that could consume unnecessary memory. This is particularly beneficial in systems where managing multiple instances, such as several game engines, could lead to significant resource overhead. By centralizing responsibilities in a single instance, the pattern minimizes memory usage and ensures efficient management of system resources.

## Consequences 
Hidden Dependencies: Since the Singleton instance can be accessed globally, it can create implicit dependencies throughout the code. This makes it harder to trace which components rely on the Singleton, leading to tightly coupled code thatâ€™s difficult to maintain and extend. As these dependencies are not immediately visible, the system becomes more complex, making refactoring challenging and increasing the risk of unintended side effects when changes are made to the Singleton or its dependent components.

Challenges in Unit Testing: Singletons can complicate unit testing because the shared instance may retain state across tests, leading to unexpected failures or inconsistent outcomes. This state persistence can interfere with test isolation, requiring additional effort to reset or mock the Singleton for each test case. The need for extra setup to ensure proper test isolation can make testing more cumbersome, especially when trying to create predictable, independent test environments.

Risk of Resource Contention: When a Singleton handles key resources like file systems, databases, or network connections, it can lead to resource contention. If multiple parts of the system attempt to access or modify the same resource simultaneously, this can create bottlenecks or slow down processing. As the system grows in complexity or user demand increases, this issue can become more severe, potentially reducing performance or limiting scalability by concentrating all access through a single shared instance.
